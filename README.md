# Portfolio

A collection of projects from various fields tied to Data Analytics, Data Science and Business Intelligence. 
_________

1) Using Kaggle dataset to provide insight into mental health patterns. Building predictive Random Forest Classifier ML model with **Sklearn**.

2) Scraping, cleaning and storing data from websites using **Python** with **BeautifulSoup** library. i) Scraping 4 Canadian stores with outdoor equipment with user input. ii) Scraping IMDB website for top 1000 movies of all time.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis and data cleanining with **Python**. Providing ML model with **Sklearn** library using time series data to predict future sales values. 

4) i) Using DAX functions and interactive dashboards made in **Power BI**, presenting a Business Intelligence case of a theoretical business. ii) Working with **MySQL** Workbench to create relational database, import and clean data and run queries.

5) Creating a ETL process with **Python** to connect to the Spotify API, grab and verify the data on songs listened in last 24 hours. **SQLite** is then used to create the database and store the data.   

6) Dashboard created in **Tableau** that analyzes City of Vancouver crime rates from 2003-2022 as well as various KPIs and metrics. Interactive dashboard can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/W73C6NYPG?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

7) Implementing **Python** computer vision libraries **cv2** and **tesseract** to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on .png/.jpg documents. Using **regex** to extract and clean data.

8) Using **Python** and the **Sklearn** library to train and build prediction model with Multinomial Logistic Regression. The model is trained on tens of thousands of data points and the goal of the model is to predict condition based on the manifested symptoms.
