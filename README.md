# Portfolio
(Work in progress)

A collection of a few small projects from various fields tied to Data Analytics, Data Science and Business Intelligence. 
_________

1) Coronavirus vaccination rates corelated with GDP per capita. Using linear regression in **Python** with Pandas and Sklearn as a statistical method to determine possible corelation between variables. [Interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/VaccinationData_16165580396780/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link) made in **Tableau** to present and analyze data. Vaccination dataset has been obtained from Kaggle. GDP per capita has been obtained from World Bank database. 

2) Scraping, cleaning and storing data from websites using **Python**. i) Scraping 4 Canadian stores with outdoor equipment with user input. ii) Scraping IMDB website for top 1000 movies of all time.

3) Using **SQLite** with matplotlib to do a basic analysis and visualisations of San Francisco bike share program. Database file is 5+ GB and can be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-data-sets/57/793589/bundle/archive.zip?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=gcp-kaggle-com%40kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210403%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210403T152112Z&X-Goog-Expires=259199&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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).

4) i) Using DAX functions and interactive dashboards made in **Power BI**, presenting a Business Intelligence case of a theoretical business. ii) Working with **MySQL** Workbench to create relational databe, import and clean data and run queries.

5) Creating a ETL process with **Python** to connect to the Spotify API, grab and verify the data on songs listened in last 24 hours. **SQLite** is then used to create the database and store the data.
